# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: October 24th, 2022

## Open Source Inside Baseball

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for October 24th, 2022](https://youtu.be/UygfNt5oLmM).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
our special guest was dear friend-of-Oxide,
[Stephen O'Grady](https://twitter.com/sogrady).
Other speakers on October 24th included
[XXX](),
and [YY]().
(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- For non-American and/or non-baseball fans "inside baseball" is an idiom meaning "an expert's take or opinion"
- Also, Stephen, Bryan, and Adam love actual baseball so there was quite a bit of that as well...
- For the baseball fans, [the Bryce Harper at bat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efDLfPEn07s) we were so excited about
- The main event: Stephen's [The Dead End](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2022/09/23/dead-end/)
- [Topic](link)
- [@M:SS](link into recording)
  *Leventhal's Conundrum*
- PRs needed!

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next Twitter space will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time; stay tuned
to our Twitter feeds for details.  We'd love to have you join us, as we
always love to hear from new speakers!
