# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: August 1st, 2022

## Deep Tech Investing

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for August 1st, 2022](https://youtu.be/67sp1l_sDkw).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
our special guests were
[Seth Winterroth](https://twitter.com/Sethwinterroth),
and [Ian Rountree](https://twitter.com/IanRountree).
Also [Steve Tuck](https://twitter.com/ahl) was there.

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Tackling Problems of Significance in Physical Industries](https://eclipse.vc/blog/tackling-problems-of-significance-in-physical-industries/) by Seth
- [A financial argument for deep tech](https://medium.com/cantos-ventures/a-financial-argument-for-deep-tech-2b01bf6e663a) by Ian

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next Twitter space will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time; stay tuned
to our Twitter feeds for details.  We'd love to have you join us, as we
always love to hear from new speakers!
