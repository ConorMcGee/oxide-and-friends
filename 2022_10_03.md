# Oxide and Friends Twitter Space: October 3rd, 2022

## Engineering Incentives... and Misincentives

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour.
Even though it's not (yet?) a feature of Twitter Spaces, we have been
recording them all; here is
[the recording for our Twitter Space for October 3rd, 2022](https://youtu.be/SU4WT5RZAPY).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl),
speakers on October 3rd included
[XXX](),
and [YY]().
(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Topic](link)
- [@M:SS](link into recording) *Leventhal's Conundrum*
- [The Cobra Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive#The_original_cobra_effect)
- [Adam's **favorite** psychology experiment](https://youtu.be/meiU6TxysCg?t=78) involving fairness, monkeys, cucumber, and grapes
- PRs needed!

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next Twitter space will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time; stay tuned
to our Twitter feeds for details.  We'd love to have you join us, as we
always love to hear from new speakers!
